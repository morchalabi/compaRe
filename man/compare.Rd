\title{Comparing two samples by measuring their similarity}
\usage{
compare(smpl1 = NULL, smpl2 = NULL, n_ = 5, par_ = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{smpl1}{First smaple as a matrix or data frame object}

\item{smpl2}{Second sample}

\item{n_}{Number by which each dimension (column) is divided (default 5)}

\item{par_}{Whether or not to use parallelism (defaults TRUE)}
}
\value{
Similarity value
}
\description{
It returns spatial similarity of two data sets with equal number of columns (variables) and any number
of rows (observations).
}
\details{
Benefiting from dynamic programming, it grids two datasets individually into spatial units, hypercubes,
and measures the difference between their ratios in each pair of corresponding hypercubes. Averaging all the
differences across all the pairs represents the overall similarity between the two datasets. For more information

# Step 1: Reading in fcs files

data("compaRe_data")

# Step 2: Transforming data

smpl1[ smpl1 < 0 ] = 0      # negative values in a fcs files are noise
smpl1 = log(smpl1+1)        # fcs data are logarithmically distributed
smpl2[ smpl2 < 0 ] = 0
smpl2 = log(smpl2+1)

# Step 3: Comparing (measuring similarity)

message(compaRe::compare(smpl1 = smpl1, smpl2 = smpl2, n_ = 4))
