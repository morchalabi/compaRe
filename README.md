# COMPARE

COMPARE is an R package with two functions for similarity measurement and clustering. It employs a dynamic programming algorithm to measure spatial similarity between two given datasets. One can then use this function to generate a similarity/affinity matrix which can then be input to the clustering function. The clustering function reports maximal cliques as clusters and dense areas as communities. COMPARE
1. is data-size independent
1. can effectively circumvent moderate background noise (like batch effect)
1. does not need  dimension reduction
1. does not need subsampling

## How it works

For more information about its algorithms check out COMPARE-suite's [similarity](https://github.com/morchalabi/COMPARE-suite/wiki/COMPARE-Suite#similarity-matrix-generator) and [clustering](https://github.com/morchalabi/COMPARE-suite/wiki/COMPARE-Suite#clustering) modules. COMPARE-suite is a pipeline for high-throughput and high-content multiparameter screening built on COMPARE.
